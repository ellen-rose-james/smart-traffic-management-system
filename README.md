# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview

This program processes a series of traffic camera frames to detect and highlight moving vehicles. It uses image processing techniques such as frame differencing, thresholding, dilation, and contour detection to identify vehicles in a specific zone of the frame.

## Detailed Explanation

### Importing Necessary Packages

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries for image processing and plotting.

## Loading and Sorting Frames

The program loads frames from a directory named frames/ and sorts them numerically.

## Storing Frames in a List

It reads each frame using OpenCV and stores them in a list.

## Displaying Selected Frames

The program displays two consecutive frames (frame 13 and 14) using Matplotlib.

## Frame Differencing

It converts the selected frames to grayscale and computes the absolute difference between them.

## Image Thresholding

The program applies a binary threshold to the difference image to highlight moving objects.

## Image Dilation

It dilates the thresholded image to fill in gaps and make the contours more pronounced.

## Vehicle Detection Zone

The program draws a line on the dilated image to define the vehicle detection zone.

## Contour Detection

It finds contours in the thresholded image and filters them based on their position and area.

## Drawing Contours

Finally, the program draws the valid contours and the detection zone line on the original frame.

## Conclusion

This program effectively detects moving vehicles in a series of traffic camera frames by using various image processing techniques. The detected vehicles are highlighted, and a specific zone is defined for vehicle detection.
